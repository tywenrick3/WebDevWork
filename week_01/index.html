                John Berger starts off by expanding your thinking on the human eye. “The Eye of the Beholder” and how its reality is utterly complex. 
                He moves on to talking about european art and how a certain mysticism and religiosity surrounds these works giving them their sense of awe. 
                He then deconstructs this mysticism and explains how it is in fact just a substitute for what the paintings lost when the camera was invented, rendering the paintings reproducible. 
                I found this point so interesting. I have always thought about the value behind great works of art that Berger was discussing. 
                I have wondered what about them truly encapsulates their absurd value. A sense of history and relic preservation was what I always believed warranted their importance. 
                I also recognized this odd mystery that surround the ancient pieces. But the way in which Berger opened up the idea behind their mystery, exposing the camera as a culprit and reason behind the religiosity. 
                It made me think about how many other facets of society the camera revolutionized. Completely reworking reality to the “Eye Of the Beholder”, 
                by being able to capture the past to preserve in the present in a way no painting or drawing could ever get close to.
