                Science and technology should be used to better expand our minds and push our psychological capabilities. Efficiency and physical workload being irrelevant to larger theory based topics. In ‚ÄúAs We May Think‚Äù by Vannevar Bush I found the core meaning to be very interesting. For as long as we can remember, humans have been using tools and technologies to make life easier for them. Speeding up efficiency and increasing productivity. We have more free time and less is spent on repetitive or laborious work. Bush pushes the idea that using technology to expand our minds is the key to thriving. I found the example with the store to be extremely convincing. There are so many tasks that are made easier through technological systems, making it easier for staff to focus on the areas of true importance requiring much thought, such as advertising and marketing. But I do think that the entire physical and labor issues solved by technology have always trended towards this goal. They free up time to focus on our thoughts, desires, passions, hobbies and other mental tasks.

                In Long Live The Web by Tim Burners Lee, I found the ending to be extraordinarily interesting. Lee talks about the future of the web and what he is excited for. He explains how as of right now, the web is a place where data is being uploaded at an extraordinarily rate. Documents are constantly being added, with the ability to be seen by anybody. But as of right now the machine is not truly able to interact with the data. And so much is affected by this. As computers begin to be able to interact with the data and documents that populate the web, so many new possibilities for advancement arise. I began thinking about all of the underground and unpopular discoveries that may not be so lucky to make it to mainstream media. Or fake news that surfaces with nothing backing its claims. As we are able to fix this problem and create more ways for computer interaction to be possible. So many new areas for improvement and progress will begin to emerge.
