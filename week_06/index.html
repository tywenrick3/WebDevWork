        <div class="item item1-info">Separation is itself part of the unity of the world, of the global social praxis split up into reality and image. The social practice which the autonomous spectacle confronts is also the real totality which contains the spectacle. But the split within this totality mutilates it to the point of making the spectacle appear as its goal. The language of the spectacle consists of signs of the ruling production, which at the same time are the ultimate goal of this production.</div>
        <div class="item item2-info">The images detached from every aspect of life fuse in a common stream in which the unity of this life can no longer be reestablished. Reality considered partially unfolds, in its own general unity, as a pseudo-world apart, an object of mere contemplation. The specialization of images of the world is completed in the world of the autonomous image, where the liar has lied to himself. The spectacle in general, as the concrete inversion of life, is the autonomous movement of the non-living.</div>
        <div class="item item3-info">Reality has been reinvented. Times have changed, what we have access to alters our perspective entirely. Reality isn't something we tangibly experience, a finite understanding no longer exists. We are watchers now. Observers of this “spectacle” that is this new social realm. </div>
        <div class="item item4-info">In a world which really is topsy-turvy, the true is a moment of the false.</div>
        <div class="item item5-info">In societies where modern conditions of production prevail, all of life presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles. Everything that was directly lived has moved away into a representation.</div>
